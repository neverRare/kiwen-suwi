# Kiwen Suwi

Chess theme made to be elegant, minimalist, and adorable. Works well with light-shaded board.

<img src="./version/latest/kiwen-suwi/preview.png" width="500" alt="Chess pieces in very simple design. White pieces are solid white shapes with black outline. Black pieces are just solid black shapes with no outline. Knights looks like sock puppet." />

## High contrast (Deprecated)

Pieces with highest contrast possible. Works well with any board!

**Note**: Deprecated, will be replaced with a better design

<img src="./version/latest/kiwen-suwi-high-contrast/preview.png" width="500" alt="Chess pieces using pure white and black shade. White pieces remained the same and black pieces have white outlines." />

## Font

A very legible font, thanks to its simplicity. Optimized for figurine notation. (ASCII or Latin glyphs not included in the font)

<img src="./version/latest/preview-font.png" width="500" alt="1. e4, e5, 2. Knight to f3, Knight to c6, 3. Bishop to c4, Bishop to c5" />
