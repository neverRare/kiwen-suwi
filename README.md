A [pull request adding kiwen suwi to Lichess][pull request] has been merged. It's not yet available on Lichess itself but at anytime it may become available. So if you're using [Lichess] and want kiwen suwi, just wait!

On [Chess.com] however, kiwen suwi is very unlikely to get added. So one have to customize it with third-party browser extension: [customization instruction][customize].

I don't encourage this. I recommend waiting but if you can't wait and want to customize [Lichess] anyway with third-party browser extension, [here's the instruction][customize].
