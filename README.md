## Black only

Black only glyphs intended for fonts (see below). Black pieces are filled and white pieces are hollow black outline.

## Font

A very legible font, thanks to its simplicity. Intended for figurine notation.

![pawn to e4, pawn to e5, knight to f3, knight to c6, bishop to c4, bishop to c5](./version/1.200/preview-font.png)
